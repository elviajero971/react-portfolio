# My Portfolio - React TypeScript Application

## 🚀 Introduction

This repository contains the code for my **personal portfolio** built with **React** and **TypeScript**. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a front-end developer. It is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and easily maintainable. 

## 🎯 Features
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React.
- Built with **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience.
- Modular and scalable component architecture.
- **Responsive design** that adapts to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Reusable components** and styles using CSS Modules/Tailwind CSS.
- Easy configuration and customization.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd portfolio

# Install dependencies using npm or yarn
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

### Running the Application

After the installation is complete, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

This will start the application and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `build/` folder, which can be deployed to any hosting service.

## ⚙️ Running Tests

If there are unit tests or integration tests, you can run them using the following command:

```bash
npm test
# OR
yarn test
```

This command runs the test suite defined in the repository, ensuring all components and functionality work as expected.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript providing static type definitions.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.
- **CSS Modules** or **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier**: For maintaining code quality and consistent formatting.
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library**: For unit and integration testing.
